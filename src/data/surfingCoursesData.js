      `Our courses for beginners involve detailed theory sessions every day in our classroom to help students understand the complex elements involved such as gear selection, reading the tides, swells, and of course, safety. After theory, step into the water and learn how to read and select the right waves, pop up with ease, and paddle into your own waves. If you want to get serious about surfing, we recommend taking our 5-day beginner course. This course will teach you the basics you will need to become an independent surfer in the future. After finishing our 5-day course, you will receive a certificate of participation and notes with main highlights of the course.`,
      `If you take the 5-day course, we will arrange a videographer to take videos of you during surfing so you can see where to improve during post-surf analysis. You have the option of hiring a photographer yourself for shorter courses. The course follows the standard curriculum certified.`,

      `We now offer new Intermediate Surf Courses! These are geared towards surfers who have already gone through beginners courses before and want to exponentially improve their surf skills. Unlike beginner surfers, intermediate surfers all have different skill sets which they need to improve on. Our intermediate course is very personalized, starting with an interview to assess your needs and a practical surf session to evaluate your current skills.`,
      `Our goal is to get you surfing faster and enjoying more waves! For more information or to book, contact us on WhatsApp 054-2222-222 or email us at hello@surfschool.com.`,
